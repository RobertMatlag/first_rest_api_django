This is my first project in django. I create simple rest api using Django and postgreSQL database.
There are 3 endpoints: albums, songs, playlists. I prepared GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE method for each endpoint.

I didn't use DRF, because it is project to get know better core of django. 

I disable CSRF only for education needed.
